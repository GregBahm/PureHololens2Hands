# Pure Hololens 2 Hands
If you're new to developing for the Hololens 2, you should start with the fabulous [MRTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity). However, MRTK (which includes over 60,000 lines of code) feels like extreme overkill if all you really want is some hands.

This project provides a Hands prefab that will work with HL2 hand tracking using OpenXR. These hands will also work in the Unity editor through Holographic Remoting for Play Mode.
